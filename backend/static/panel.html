                <ul>
                    <li>Transactions are direct orders as well as order updates (shipping, payment processing, invetory updates, etc)</li>
                    <li>Our goal this year is expanding in the APAC market</li>
                    <li>We are a Python shop and some things also done in C#</li>
                    <li>We deploy on AWS today</li>
                    <li>On Microsoft SQL today</li>
                    <li>We need search. We don't have it today but think we achieve it by using SQL %LIKE% statements</li>
                    <li>Our CIO saw in a magazine that if we don't introduce AI to our online shop, we will go out of business. But we do not know where to start or if it is a fad (like is anyone doing this for real?)</li>
                    <li>We batch processes orders once a morning (doing yesterday's orders, or on Monday we do Fri and the weekend). This leads us to be slow on triaging orders (especially on Mondays) and we may find things are out of stock</li>
                    <li>One group of the company uses Kafka to send payment data from the ecommerce side to the CRM side. We host this connector manually today.</li>
                    <li>Could like to get more real time insights and recommendations for our customers as well as archive some old stuff</li>
                    <li>Our site is slow... just try it out</li>
                    <li>We scale up before holiday time every year to handle the load. We can only scale up, cannot shard/horizontally scale</li>
                    <li>We didn't tell the customer to go to this website, but the link was in the prep materials</li>
