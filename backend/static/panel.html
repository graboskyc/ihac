                    <ul>
                        <li>Transactions are direct orders as well as order updates (shipping, payment processing, inventory updates, etc)</li>
                        <li>Our goal this year is expanding in the APAC market</li>
                        <li>Our CIO saw in a magazine that if we don't introduce AI to our online shop, we will go out of business. But we do not know where to start or if it is a fad (like is anyone doing this for real?)</li>
                        <li>Our site is slow... just try it out</li>
                        <li>We scale up before holiday time every year to handle the load. We can only scale up, cannot shard/horizontally scale</li>
                        <li>We didn't tell the Candidate to go to this website, but the link was in the prep materials</li>

                        <li>Tech Stack:
                            <ul>
                                <li>We are a Python shop and some things also done in C#</li>
                                <li>We deploy on AWS today</li>
                                <li>On Microsoft SQL today</li>
                                <li>Security conscious so want to use private networking</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>For ASP Interviews:

                                <li>We batch processes orders once a morning (doing yesterday's orders, or on Monday we do Fri and the weekend). This leads us to be slow on triaging orders (especially on Mondays) and we may find things are out of stock</li>
                                <li>Sending shipping notifications and more is a manual process</li>
                                <li>One group of the company uses Kafka to send payment data from the ecommerce side to the CRM side. We host this connector manually today.</li>
                                <li>Would like to get more real time insights and dashboards</li>
                                <li>Some items on our site commonly require additional things to purchase along with it (connectors, tools, etc) so adding a recommendation engine is desireable</li>
